    <b>Name</b><br>
    Mexican Snowball<br>
    <br>
    <b>Origin</b><br>
    Native to the semi-desert habitats in Mexico.<br>
    <br>
    <b>How to Grow and Care</b><br>
    Mexican Snowball is certainly one of the most versatile neat, low-growing ground cover succulents. It is easy to care for and is a good starting point for beginning gardeners. It is considered to be drought tolerant but it does best with occasional watering in a well drained soil. This is typical of many Echeveria. They can be planted in full sun in coastal areas and they like some light shade when planted inland. Elsewhere grow as a houseplant in winter in a cool, bright window and keep dry until spring.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Watering</b><br>
    Water moderately when in growth; not at all when dormant.<br>

  <p>
    <b>Name</b><br>
    Burro’s Tail <br>
    <br>
    <b>Origin</b><br>
    Native to southern Mexico and Honduras.<br>
    <br>
    <b>How to Grow and Care</b><br>
    Sedum morganianum likes bright shade or partial sun. Like any other succulent, this one needs good drainage.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Watering</b><br>
    All those leaves store water so be sure not to overwater it. It will rot out if you do. My Burro’s Tail is well established (around 5 years old) so I water it every 10-14 days but give it a thorough drink.<br>
